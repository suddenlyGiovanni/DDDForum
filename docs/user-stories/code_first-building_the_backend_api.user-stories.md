## Epic 1: User Registration

### Story 1.1: User Account Creation
**As a** new user

**So that** I can access the DDD Forum platform

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] I can submit my email, username, first name, and last name
- [ ] The system validates that all required fields are provided
- [ ] The system checks that my email is unique across all users
- [ ] The system checks that my username is unique across all users
- [ ] The system generates a secure random password for my account
- [ ] I receive confirmation that my account was created successfully
- [ ] I receive my user ID and profile information in the response

#### Technical Requirements
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/users`
- **Request Body**: `{ email, username, firstName, lastName }`
- **Success Response**: `201 - { error: undefined, data: { id, email, username, firstName, lastName }, success: true }`
- **Database**: Insert new user record with auto-generated ID and random password

#### Error Scenarios
- [ ] If email is already in use: `409 - { error: "EmailAlreadyInUse", data: undefined, success: false }`
- [ ] If username is already taken: `409 - { error: "UsernameAlreadyTaken", data: undefined, success: false }`
- [ ] If required fields are missing: `400 - { error: "ValidationError", data: undefined, success: false }`
- [ ] If system error occurs: `500 - { error: "ServerError", data: undefined, success: false }`

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] API endpoint is implemented and tested
- [ ] Database schema supports user creation
- [ ] All validation rules are enforced
- [ ] All error scenarios return correct status codes
- [ ] Random password generation is secure
- [ ] Unit and integration tests pass

## Epic 2: User Profile Management

### Story 2.1: User Profile Updates
**As a** registered user  
**I want to** update my profile information  
**So that** I can keep my account details current and accurate

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] I can update my email address (if not already in use by another user)
- [ ] I can update my username (if not already taken by another user)
- [ ] I can update my first name and last name
- [ ] The system validates that all provided fields are not empty
- [ ] The system prevents me from using an email or username that belongs to another user
- [ ] I receive confirmation that my profile was updated successfully
- [ ] I receive my updated profile information in the response

#### Technical Requirements
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/users/:userId`
- **Request Body**: `{ email, username, firstName, lastName }`
- **Success Response**: `200 - { error: undefined, data: { id, email, username, firstName, lastName }, success: true }`
- **Database**: Update existing user record by ID

#### Error Scenarios
- [ ] If user ID doesn't exist: `404 - { error: "UserNotFound", data: undefined, success: false }`
- [ ] If new email is already in use: `409 - { error: "EmailAlreadyInUse", data: undefined, success: false }`
- [ ] If new username is already taken: `409 - { error: "UsernameAlreadyTaken", data: undefined, success: false }`
- [ ] If validation fails: `400 - { error: "ValidationError", data: undefined, success: false }`
- [ ] If system error occurs: `500 - { error: "ServerError", data: undefined, success: false }`

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] API endpoint is implemented and tested
- [ ] User lookup by ID is functional
- [ ] Uniqueness constraints are enforced during updates
- [ ] All validation rules are applied
- [ ] All error scenarios return correct status codes
- [ ] Unit and integration tests pass

## Epic 3: User Discovery

### Story 3.1: User Lookup by Email
**As a** system or administrator  
**I want to** find a user by their email address  
**So that** I can retrieve their profile information for authentication or administrative purposes

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] I can search for a user by providing their email address
- [ ] If the user exists, I receive their complete profile information
- [ ] If the user doesn't exist, I receive a clear "not found" response
- [ ] The search is case-insensitive for email addresses
- [ ] I receive appropriate error messages for system issues

#### Technical Requirements
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/users?email=someuser@gmail.com`
- **Query Parameter**: `email` (required)
- **Success Response**: `200 - { error: undefined, data: { id, email, username, firstName, lastName }, success: true }`
- **Database**: Query user by email address

#### Error Scenarios
- [ ] If user not found: `404 - { error: "UserNotFound", data: undefined, success: false }`
- [ ] If system error occurs: `500 - { error: "ServerError", data: undefined, success: false }`

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] API endpoint is implemented and tested
- [ ] Email-based user lookup is functional
- [ ] Case-insensitive email matching works
- [ ] All error scenarios return correct status codes
- [ ] Unit and integration tests pass

## Epic 4: Foundation Infrastructure

### Story 4.1: Database Schema Setup
**As a** developer  
**I want to** set up the user database schema  
**So that** user data can be stored and retrieved reliably

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users table is created with all required fields
- [ ] Primary key auto-increment is configured
- [ ] Unique constraints are applied to email and username fields
- [ ] All fields are set as NOT NULL
- [ ] Database indexes are optimized for common queries

#### Technical Requirements
- **Table**: `users`
- **Fields**: 
  - `id` (PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
  - `email` (VARCHAR, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
  - `username` (VARCHAR, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
  - `firstName` (VARCHAR, NOT NULL)
  - `lastName` (VARCHAR, NOT NULL)
  - `password` (VARCHAR, NOT NULL)

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] Database schema is implemented
- [ ] Unique constraints are working
- [ ] Database connection is established
- [ ] Migration scripts are created (if applicable)
- [ ] Schema documentation is updated

### Story 4.2: Error Handling Framework
**As a** developer  
**I want to** implement consistent error handling  
**So that** all API responses follow the same format and provide clear feedback

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All API endpoints return consistent error response format
- [ ] Different error types are properly categorized (400, 404, 409, 500)
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly but not too revealing
- [ ] Server errors are logged for debugging
- [ ] Try-catch blocks wrap all database operations

#### Technical Requirements
- **Error Response Format**: `{ error: "ErrorType", data: undefined, success: false }`
- **Error Types**: ValidationError, UserNotFound, UsernameAlreadyTaken, EmailAlreadyInUse, ServerError
- **Logging**: Server errors should be logged with details

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] Error handling middleware is implemented
- [ ] All error types return correct HTTP status codes
- [ ] Error response format is consistent
- [ ] Server errors are properly logged
- [ ] Error handling is tested
